# Basic C++ Linear Algebra Library

## What is it?
A simple C++ library for performing basic linear algebra operations.
I built this for use in some other personal projects.
Included:
* Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication
* Dot Product
* Matrix Addition, Scalar Multiplication, and Matrix Multiplication
* Calculation of Matrix Spaces, including nullspace, column space and row space
* Calculation of the determinant using LU decomposition


## How to use?
just include the library
